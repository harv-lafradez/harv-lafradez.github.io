Mānoa Melody is a website my team and I developed during ICS 314 as our software engineering final project. This web application hopes to resolve an ongoing issue that many musically-inclined students at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa face--the means to connect and network with other like-minded individuals who share the same musical interests and talents. Hence, Mānoa Melody is a web application that does just that. 

### Finding the melody

After graduating college with a degree in civil engineering, you find yourself with no job opportunities. You decide to restore your family’s abandoned farm and make a living as a farmer. Grow crops and sell them at the town’s market! But as the night falls, you soon realize why the farm was abandoned in the first place.

Follow Fluffy the bunny on a farming journey like no other, literally.

### Working in harmony
