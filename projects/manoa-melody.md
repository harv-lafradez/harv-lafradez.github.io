Mānoa Melody is a website my team and I developed during ICS 314 as our software engineering final project. This web application hopes to resolve an ongoing issue that many musically-inclined students at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa face--the means to connect and network with other like-minded individuals who share the same musical interests and talents. Hence, Mānoa Melody is a web application that does just that.
