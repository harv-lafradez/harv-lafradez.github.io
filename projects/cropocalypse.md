Cropocalypse is a 2D top-down survival farming simulator game with pixel graphics developed by my team and I in ICS 369 utilizing Unity game engine during the spring 2023 semester. The game draws inspiration from well-known indie titles similar to "Stardew Valley" and "Enter the Gungeon" aiming to combine two starkly different motifs: peaceful farming simulator and hectic bullet hell in a quirky and cute way.

### Synopsis

After graduating college with a degree in civil engineering, you find yourself with no job opportunities. You decide to restore your family’s abandoned farm and make a living as a farmer. Grow crops and sell them at the town’s market! But as the night falls, you soon realize why the farm was abandoned in the first place.

Follow Fluffy the bunny on a farming journey like no other, literally.
