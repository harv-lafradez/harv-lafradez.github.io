<p>In my limited experience with programming, I truly believe that JavaScript is just “that girl” of programming languages. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, “that girl” is essentially a viral wellness trend that encourages those taking it on to embrace the best version of themselves or, to put it simply, get their life together and look good doing it too. It is essentially a label used to describe a lifestyle that everyone should strive to attain. Though, what does this entail about JavaScript, you may ask? Well, as someone who just picked it up in the past month, JavaScript is literally that girl all the other programming languages just wish they were.</p>

<h2 id="humble-beginnings">Humble beginnings</h2>

<p>I began my formal programming journey learning Java, C, and the like in introductory courses throughout university. In hindsight, I did sort of understand why we were taught those programming languages from the start, with the emphasis on object-oriented programming, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Though, I felt that those programming languages, C especially, were extremely unintuitive outside of that context–aside from how pointers were a complete nightmare for me–and how strictly typed everything needed to be. However, as soon as I started learning JavaScript, I was quite shocked to be honest–or at least taken aback by how completely different the experience was.</p>

<h2 id="a-pleasant-surprise">A pleasant surprise</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, no longer was I required to assign a type to every single variable I defined, and the syntax just made sense to me. She–referring to JavaScript–was definitely the quirky one out of the bunch, but in a good way which is why she is just “that girl”. JavaScript made it so much easier and convenient to work with strings, providing convenient methods of iterating, accessing, and modifying indices without having to use obscure looping methods that have made my life difficult when working with Java or even C. Functions were also treated as variables and can be passed through as arguments or even returned from other functions, whereas Java and C both lack this amazing functionality. Although, just like any other programming language, she is not perfect–and being “that girl” does not mean you are perfect regardless. I found it interesting that in the context of object-oriented programming, JavaScript had a few caveats. One of them being that there is no secure way to protect the key-value pair values within objects from being modified in other parts of a program, whereas programming languages like Java have access modifiers like public and private that protect data within objects.</p>

<p>Through JavaScript’s standardization, that is ES6, programming could not have been made any more convenient. I especially enjoyed arrow functions and how they can be utilized to make code more concise. I also loved how destructuring assignments made working with objects more intuitive. From a software engineering perspective, I believe JavaScript is an incredibly powerful programming language to utilize for its versatility, though it is a shame that JavaScript can only be used in the context of web development.</p>

<h2 id="im-not-exactly-athletic-but-more-so-optimistic">I’m not exactly athletic, but more so optimistic</h2>

<p>In regards to athletic software engineering, I am actually starting to warm up to this method of learning. I believe that introducing a stress factor through the time limit is a valid way of simulating the real stressors that come with technical interviews further down the road when we, as students, start applying for jobs outside of this course. Although, I do not think it is the most enjoyable, I do, however, think that it is necessary to have that sort of experience working within a time limit to solve a problem and apply the skills you have learned to become more efficient in the future. I have found that the practice problems were quite useful in preparing for an actual exam. Though they do have the tendency to become repetitive, I do see now why that is the case, as we eventually want to have the muscle memory to be able to work more efficiently. I do have hopes that athletic software engineering will work for me, as long as I put in the time and effort to practice as if I were an actual athlete.</p>
