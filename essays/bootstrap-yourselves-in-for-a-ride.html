<h2 id="from-joyride-to-roller-coaster">From joyride to roller coaster</h2>

<p>If learning to create webpages using both HTML and CSS is like learning to drive automatic, then learning to create webpages using Bootstrap 5 must be like learning to drive stick or manual. <em>I can’t drive stick</em>. In my brutally honest opinion, learning Bootstrap 5 has been the worst experience I have had in my web development journey thus far, and that says a lot because I usually enjoy creating webpages and the like, though being a die-hard raw HTML and CSS enthusiast, I may be a tad bit biased. Though nevertheless, Bootstrap 5 has indeed given me an interesting experience to say the least when it came to building a webpage either from scratch or through replication. While yes, I do recognize that pure HTML and CSS can be tedious, and rightfully so as I have found challenge in arranging webpage elements to where I want them to be, Bootstrap 5 I admit does offer more flexible means of managing webpage element layouts. Though, learning Bootstrap 5 has been nothing short of a roller coaster for me personally, and you will soon find out why.</p>

<p>Above are images of a side-by-side comparison between an official webpage and a mock-up I created strictly using Bootstrap 5 styling. I chose to recreate a simple webpage of my favorite collector’s item, Smiski! The image on the left is the official Smiski webpage, while the right is my mock-up. As someone who just got thrown into using Bootstrap 5, I would say I am quite proud of what I was able to recreate. However, it was not at all painless. I had an especially difficult time understanding how to get the correct layout through using Bootstrap 5 alone, and I found myself spending hours on end staring at the documentation trying to comprehend the lines of HTML code provided in their examples. I soon realized that I was approaching not just Bootstrap 5, but UI frameworks as a whole the wrong way. I was using Bootstrap 5 as if it were a magic wand that would instantly recreate the webpage.</p>

<p>In reality, Bootstrap 5 is a powerful tool, but it requires a solid understanding of its components and classes to harness its full potential. Although I do not have sufficient time to master Bootstrap 5 and fully understand every single one of its structures, I now realize that implementing it did not have to be a torturous task. While Bootstrap 5 provides a wide range of pre-designed components, the best way I found to go about utilizing it was through trial and error. The modularity of UI frameworks, especially those like Bootstrap 5, allows one to copy paste desired elements and further modify them to fit the specific needs and aesthetics of the webpage being worked on. Bootstrap 5 has its own specific styles for certain elements, hence why it is a <em>framework</em> for CSS, and it is completely up to the developer to further specify through highly specific overrides if they so choose. Though in my case, I merely needed to change a few text and background styles. Also, an interesting observation I have found while working with Bootstrap 5 was that I found myself spending less time defining CSS and more time in the HTML assigning classes to elements, which is what I feel is the whole point of UI Frameworks as a collective.</p>

<h2 id="the-road-to-success">The road to success</h2>

<p>In the end, while Bootstrap 5 might have felt like a roller coaster ride at times, it has been a valuable journey of growth and discovery. Learning to harness its power has given me the tools to create responsive and visually appealing webpages more efficiently. As I continue on this road of web development, I look forward to mastering Bootstrap 5 and incorporating it into my toolkit, knowing that it can be a powerful ally when used with the right knowledge and approach. The road to success in web development may have its twists and turns, but with determination and the right tools, it’s a journey worth taking.</p>
