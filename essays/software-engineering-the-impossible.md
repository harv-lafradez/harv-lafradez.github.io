## First impressions
From the very first day in this course, I had no idea what software engineering entailed fundamentally. I had always been under the assumption that software engineering only concerned programming prior to this course, and in hindsight, I now realize that software engineering encompasses way more than I would have ever imagined beyond the scope of programming. While yes, programming is inherently a significant aspect of software engineering, it is more so true that indirect concepts that govern programming practices are just as, or even more important when working on software development of any kind. Throughout this course, I was introduced to a plethora of software engineering concepts, though several in particular stood out to me including: functional programming, development environments, and coding standards.
