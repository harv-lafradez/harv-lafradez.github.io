## First impressions
From the very first day in this course, I had no idea what software engineering entailed fundamentally. I had always been under the assumption that software engineering only concerned programming prior to this course, and in hindsight, I now realize that software engineering encompasses way more than I would have ever imagined beyond the scope of programming. While yes, programming is inherently a significant aspect of software engineering, it is more so true that indirect concepts that govern programming practices are just as, or even more important when working on software development of any kind. Throughout this course, I was introduced to a plethora of software engineering concepts, though several in particular stood out to me including: functional programming, development environments, and coding standards.

## Going from dysfunctional to functional
Functional programming, out of all the topics discussed throughout the course, has been the most eye-opening for me personally. What functional programming essentially entails is utilizing the Underscore.js library, which is a JavaScript library that provides useful helper functions. Functional programming has allowed me to traverse data structures including objects without the need for loops. It has immensely influenced my programming practices and made my code more readable, concise, and compact, which is imperative when working on software projects with multiple members who will also read the code you have written. Functional programming in the context of software engineering allows code readability to be less convoluted or dysfunctional.

## The environment and you
Prior to this course, I always knew what development environments were, but never to the extent that this course has introduced to me. Up until I learned more about development environments, my basic assumption was that it only concerned the code editor one uses, but to my surprise there was more to it than that. Development environments are essentially the tools through which one utilizes when working on a software project, not necessarily just the code editor. In this course, I learned how to make use of the IntelliJ integrated development environment, which I had no prior knowledge of, and also learned how to set up and configure this specific environment such that my development experience was optimized. Outside of the code editor, a development environment could also include , the shell or terminal one uses to run their project, the plugins or packages one installs, or even the the documentation one references. Essentially, development environments allows one to streamline the software development process as they always say, "a tool is only as effective as the skillfulness of the hands that wield it".

## Never lower your standards
Coding standards were always a recurring motif, even in courses that were outside the scope of software engineering. When I first learned how to program in Java, coding standards were always enforced onto my coding practices. This course has reinforced my knowledge of coding standards and their significance, especially when working on software projects. If no coding standards were ever enforced, software engineering would be a mess, literally. Code would not be readable. Team members would be lost amidst a sea of convoluted code with no comments. It most definitely would be a disaster. Which is why coding standards and their governance over programming practices is an important aspect of software engineering and was one of the more insightful and important concepts to learn throughout this course.

## The impossible made possible
Overall, this course has been a transformative journey, reshaping my initial misconceptions about software engineering. I've come to appreciate that software engineering goes far beyond mere programming, encompassing crucial concepts such as functional programming, development environments, and coding standards. Functional programming, with its emphasis on code readability and conciseness, has significantly influenced my approach, making me realize the importance of clarity in collaborative projects. Exploring development environments expanded my understanding beyond code editors, emphasizing the holistic tools and configurations that optimize the software development process. Finally, the emphasis on coding standards served as a powerful reminder of their role in maintaining order and readability in the intricate landscape of software engineering. This course has not only broadened my technical skills but instilled a deeper appreciation for the multifaceted nature of software engineering.
