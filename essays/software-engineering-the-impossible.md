## First impressions
From the very first day in this course, I had no idea what software engineering entailed fundamentally. I had always been under the assumption that software engineering only concerned programming prior to this course, and in hindsight, I now realize that software engineering encompasses way more than I would have ever imagined beyond the scope of programming. While yes, programming is inherently a significant aspect of software engineering, it is more so true that indirect concepts that govern programming practices are just as, or even more important when working on software development of any kind. Throughout this course, I was introduced to a plethora of software engineering concepts, though several in particular stood out to me including: functional programming, development environments, and coding standards.

## Going from dysfunctional to functional
Functional programming, out of all the topics discussed throughout the course, has been the most eye-opening for me personally. What functional programming essentially entails is utilizing the Underscore.js library, which is a JavaScript library that provides useful helper functions. Functional programming has allowed me to traverse data structures including objects without the need for loops. It has immensely influenced my programming practices and made my code more readable, concise, and compact, which is imperative when working on software projects with multiple members who will also read the code you have written. Functional programming in the context of software engineering allows code readability to be less convoluted or dysfunctional.

## The environment and you
