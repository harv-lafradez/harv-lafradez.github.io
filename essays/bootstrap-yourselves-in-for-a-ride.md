## From joyride to roller coaster

If learning to create webpages using both HTML and CSS is like learning to drive automatic, then learning to create webpages using Bootstrap 5 must be like learning to drive stick or manual. *I can't drive stick*. In my brutally honest opinion, learning Bootstrap 5 has been the worst experience I have had in my web development journey thus far, and that says a lot because I usually enjoy creating webpages and the like, though being a die-hard raw HTML and CSS enthusiast, I may be a tad bit biased. Though nevertheless, Bootstrap 5 has indeed given me an interesting experience to say the least when it came to building a webpage either from scratch or through replication. While yes, I do recognize that pure HTML and CSS can be tedious, and rightfully so as I have found challenge in arranging webpage elements to where I want them to be, Bootstrap 5 I admit does offer more flexible means of managing webpage element layouts. Though, learning Bootstrap 5 has been nothing short of a roller coaster for me personally, and you will soon find out why.
