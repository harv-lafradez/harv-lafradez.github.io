## Introduction

From the rise of new technologies, artificial intelligence has remained at the forefront of controversy when it comes to ethical use within a plethora of fields. In education specifically,
artificial intelligence has either been coveted as a tool to enhance learning, or a tool that contrarily hinders critical thinking and problem-solving altogether. While both sides pose valid
arguments when it comes to artificial intelligence and its use in educational settings, who is to say that both points are mutually exclusive? Artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT and 
GitHub Copilot are only a couple of the various programs made available to students who are interested in utilizing this growing technology, and are the main artificial intellince tools that I
regularly utilize when necessary, especially in courses such as ICS 314. Despite its controversial nature, artificial intelligence is a powerful too nonetheless and can both help or harm one's 
own learning.

## Personal Experience with AI

### Experience WODs

I did not use any artificial intelligence tools when I worked on the course's Experience WODs as most of the answers were already made available to me on the assignments themselves. If I had
any difficulties, resources such as the smart-questions channel on the Discord as well as my fellow peers were also available to me. Frankly, I felt that using artificial intelligence for
Experience WODs was unnecessary and an extra step when I could just watch the solution video instead. 

### In-Class Practice WODs

Similarly to Experience WODs, I did not find much use of artificial intelligence altogether. The solutions were already made available to me after the soft time limit in class and I felt that
asking ChatGPT would be an extra step and waste time.

### In-Class WODs

Throughout the course's In-Class WODs I did not find the use of artificial intelligence to be as helpful. Although ChatGPT was made readily available for me to use, I figured that in many
cases, it would not provide the exact answer I was looking for. For instance, the In-Class WODs that involved Bootstrap 5, React, and Meteor were far too complex user-interface-wise, and
because those specific WODs involved multiple working parts or components, I assumed that it was far more beneficial for me to have learned how the code required for those specific WODs worked
as opposed to asking artificial intelligence to think for me. I also figured that ChatGPT would somehow have to know of the directories being utilized from a specific WOD, and thus I concluded
that it would be more so tedious and counter-intuitive to spend precious WOD time figuring out how to ask the right prompt instead of figuring the problem out myself. I felt that I saved myself 
a lot of time going solely off of my own knowledge during In-Class WODs and I ended up reinforcing my problem-solving skills under external pressure which were the time limits. 

### Essays

I did find some use for artificial intelligence when working on essays, mainly for revising spelling and grammar errors after I was done writing. I never had ChatGPT write anything for me, and
if I did, I felt that the answers it would provide did not sound like me at all nor did it fully convey what I wanted to cover according to the specific prompt.

### Final Project

I have yet to find a use for artificial intelligence while working on my final project, but I highly doubt I will have a need for it as I have my team members available to me whenever I am
in need of assistance. There are also other resources I can utilize that are already available to me from the course including past WODs and Experiences or assignments that I can use as
reference.

### Learning a Concept/Tutorial

I did not use artificial intelligence to learn a concept or tutorial, I stuck mainly to learning through the module readings and screencasts without need for consulting ChatGPT.

### Answering a Question in Class or in Discord

I did not find use for artificial intelligence when answering a question in class or in Discord as many of my other peers were readily available to contribute to whatever question was being
discussed. Again, asking ChatGPT in this case would be an extra unnecessary step.

### Asking or Answering a Smart-Question

I did not use artificial intelligence when asking or answering a smart-question as most of the inquiries I had were easily answered through referencing the respective module readings, screebcasts, or Experience
solution videos. In regards to answering a smart-question, my fellow peers served as a primary resource when discussing an inquiry and consulting ChatGPT was not necessary.

### Coding Example e.g. "Give an example of using Underscore.pluck"

I did use artificial intelligence on one occasion when asking for a coding example, specifically when we were learning about the Underscore.js library. I used ChatGPT when trying to understand the reduce function
and the specific prompt I used was "Please explain to me how the reduce function from the Underscore.js library works as if I was a five year-old". This prompt provided me with an answer that was simple to understand
and actually helped me gain a better understanding of how the reduce function works and specific examples were also provided. 

### Explaining Code

For explaining code specifically, similar to providing a coding example I also used ChatGPT to explain what specific Underscore.js functions did when I was first introduced to them. I mainly used ChatGPT to explain code snippets, for instance the prompt I would use was: 

```
"Please explain the following code snippet as if I were a five year-old:"

_.mapObject({start: 5, end: 12}, function(val, key) {
  return val + 5;
});
=> {start: 10, end: 17}
```

The answer it would provide I felt was more concise, simpler and easier to digest than most documentation, especially because some software engineering jargon would often convolute the explanations in my experience.

### Writing Code

Aside from explaining code snippets or code, I never once had to use artificial intelligence to code for me. I always felt the need to code whatever I was working on myself as that was the way I learned. I felt that 
having ChatGPT code something for me was equivalent to having someone else think for me, and that would inevitably lead to me to depend on it more so than my own knowledge which is highly undesirable in my opinion.

### Documenting Code

I never felt the need to utilize ChatGPT to create documentation for the code I write. I feel that having aritificial intelligence write code documentation for me would not be as helpful as there is potential for
the documentation to not fully cover what the code is doing, thus I prefer to document my own code myself.

### Quality Assurance

I do not think there is a need, or I have not yet found a need for, quality assurance assistance using artificial intelligence. If I wanted to fix ESLint errors in my code, I would just rely on the built in ESLint
checker in my integrated development environment that already checks for those errors and provides solutions. Also, If I wanted to figure what was wrong with my code I would often just consult a peer or a team
member to look it over for me as well. Again, using artificial intelligence for this task would be an extra step on its own.

### Other Uses in ICS 314 Not Listed

Aside from the above uses for artificial intelligence within this course, I felt that for the most part I did not have to use artificial intelligence as frequently, regardless of how accessible it was. While yes,
it can help to use it, but only when necessary. I feel that constantly turning to artificial intelligence when met with a problem no matter big or small, you create a sort of dependence on it when you indulge
in it too frequently.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI software, such as ChatGPT, has significantly impacted my learning journey and greatly improved my comprehension of software engineering principles. Whenever I encountered overly technical explanations online, 
ChatGPT offered me a more accessible and simplified interpretation of the concept. Moreover, if aspects of ChatGPT's explanations left me perplexed, I could seek clarification on the specific parts that were 
confusing. When working on assignments late at night, turning to AI for assistance with my code became my go-to option, as seeking help from others was not feasible during those hours. While ChatGPT generally 
provides valuable solutions to coding problems or various issues, it is not flawless and may occasionally offer solutions that are not particularly helpful or practical.

## Practical Applications


In the contemporary landscape, artificial intelligence is ubiquitous, seamlessly integrated into our everyday routines. Take, for instance, the proactive role it plays in enhancing the security of financial 
transactions. Rather than the need for daily scrutiny of my credit card statement to identify potential fraudulent charges, my credit card company employs automated fraud alerts that promptly notify me when a 
specified amount is charged, thereby safeguarding my account. Furthermore, the convenience of face detection software has replaced the manual input of passwords, allowing swift access to my phone and other smart 
devices within seconds. This not only offers a rapid and efficient means of unlocking my devices but also bolsters security by eliminating the necessity of entering passwords in potentially compromising situations 
where others may observe my screen.

## Challenges and Opportunities

While AI proves beneficial in generating and debugging code, its accuracy is not consistent, occasionally yielding unhelpful solutions. Consequently, I often find myself resorting to Google to troubleshoot bugs or 
decipher error messages, consuming additional time. Another drawback of relying on AI within the coursework is the potential to bypass understanding the rationale behind correct answers. The ease of obtaining 
accurate responses with a simple click fosters the temptation to lean on AI tools like ChatGPT, foregoing the effort of devising potential solutions independently. Yet, this approach hampers the acquisition of 
essential concepts that may surface in future courses or interviews, ultimately impeding my learning.

In contemplating the integration of AI into software engineering, a variety of tools are available. Generative AI resources like ChatGPT, Bard, or Co-Pilot prove valuable in debugging or generating code, 
particularly for moderately challenging problems like the WODs in ICS 314. Additionally, software such as ESLint assists in adhering to coding standards by highlighting issues like unused variables, incorrect 
imports, or mismatched data types, offering solutions to address these issues.

## Comparative Analysis

In contrast to conventional teaching methods, AI-enhanced learning emerges as an exceptionally beneficial approach, customizing the educational experience based on an individual's needs and existing knowledge of a 
subject. When a student lacks proficiency in coding or software engineering compared to their peers, they can turn to AI for explanations of various concepts tailored to their understanding, or seek assistance with 
code for challenges they struggle to resolve independently. In instances where a student finds the professor's explanation confusing, AI can be employed to simplify and further elucidate the concepts.

However, it is imperative for the student using this method to ensure a thorough grasp of the code or explanation provided by AI. While AI generally furnishes helpful and functional solutions, it is not infallible 
and may occasionally present unhelpful solutions. In such cases, the responsibility falls on the programmer to explore alternative means or independently devise a solution. Additionally, relying solely on AI without 
understanding the underlying rationale may leave a programmer ill-equipped to address subsequent issues that build upon prior ones, as they may lack the knowledge of how to solve the problem or obtain the correct 
solution.

## Future Considerations

AI is poised to deepen its integration into the realm of education. The evolution of generative AI programs like ChatGPT or GitHub CoPilot is likely to yield more precise and effective results. While the prospect of 
AI replacing certain educational roles, such as tutors, has been previously discussed, it remains a distinct possibility as students can seek assistance and receive detailed explanations within minutes from AI 
software.

Nevertheless, the continued necessity for software engineers is evident in tasks like bug detection and identifying novel ways to enhance AI for user benefit. Even as AI software progresses to a point where it can 
autonomously improve, the perspective of human software developers remains indispensable in discerning user needs and areas for improvement. Moreover, despite the potential for future advancements, the majority of 
current AI software lacks the capability to autonomously identify and rectify its own bugs.

## Conclusion

Leveraging AI in ICS 314 has proven immensely advantageous in diverse ways. Interacting with generative AI like ChatGPT provides prompt and direct answers to queries, eliminating the need to independently search for 
information on Google and sift through extensive data. Additionally, employing AI for code debugging proves to be a time-efficient approach, sparing me from the manual scrutiny of each code line during the debugging 
process.

Despite the prevailing hesitancy around incorporating AI in educational settings, there are numerous advantages to integrating it into the learning environment. AI facilitates personalized learning, enabling 
students to progress at their own pace and offering clarity on intricate concepts by breaking them down into simpler terms. Moreover, AI serves as a time-saving tool for addressing mundane issues like grammar checks 
or identifying minor coding bugs. Proficiency in utilizing and seeking assistance from AI for a variety of challenges can become a potent learning tool both inside and outside the classroom, extending its impact 
beyond traditional educational boundaries.
