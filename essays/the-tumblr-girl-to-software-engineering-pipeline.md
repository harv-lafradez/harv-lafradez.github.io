Looking back on my life choices, had I known that spending hours on my cute little Tumblr blog and profile page would eventually lead me down a rabbit hole that I—in hindsight—would have liked to climb out of when I had the chance. It all began in my freshman year of high school when I was extremely obsessed with this social media platform, also known as Tumblr. It was everything to me—as any growing adolescent would say at the time—and gave me the means to cope with the incessant noise that was teenage angst, opening me up to a world of various fandoms comprising a plethora of communities with similar interests. One might wonder, what does any of this have to do with software engineering or what exactly is a “Tumblr Girl”? Stay tuned, because I am getting there.

## An unprecedented start

The term “Tumblr Girl” is not simply a label; it is a cultural reset, the oxygen you breathe, a lifestyle, food for the soul, a moment in history—I am just messing with you. Well, originally, “Tumblr Girl” was used to describe someone, typically a young woman, who draws fashion and lifestyle inspiration from, you guessed it, Tumblr! The term has since extended beyond the constraints of gender and can now—at least I believe—be used more loosely to describe one who represents a seemingly effortless persona that has found a sense of identity in a world subscribed to the status quo. I guess one could say that Tumblr especially allowed me to solidify who I was and who I wanted to be in more ways than one.

The most coveted feature of Tumblr—in my humble opinion, of course—is the ability to customize one’s own blog or profile page as if it were its own stand-alone webpage. Though you may ask, how does one do that? Through coding, of course! Well—not really. Obviously, Tumblr provides its user base with premade templates, themes, and whatnot for easy and accessible customization. However, being the highly motivated and extremely extra person that I was—not sure if I can still say that I am—I felt that their premade templates were too mundane and, quite honestly, boring—they needed a bit more spice.

To get the most out of the customization and truly have a cute-looking blog, I had to learn HTML, which I quite honestly did not realize was a programming language at the time. For all I knew, I was just adding pretty pictures to my page to show off to the rest of the world. At the ripe old age of 14, I learned how to code for the first time, and so began the start of an endeavor that eventually followed me into university.

## A glimpse into the unknown

Software engineering has always been a prevalent topic for me throughout my academic journey as a computer science major and aspiring software developer. Although I do not have any formal experience or knowledge about what exactly software engineering is, I have had a few opportunities to work with tools that dealt with version control—an important practice in software engineering—through past courses using GitHub. It is certain that software engineering comprises various facets beyond merely programming in one’s favorite coding language, and I hope to learn more about the field as a whole moving forward. I also hope to gain a better understanding of best practices when it comes to the production of software and its maintenance, with the aspiration of applying these skills to a potential future job.

## This is only the beginning

In reflection, my journey from a fervent Tumblr user to a budding software engineer underscores the unexpected paths life can take. As I navigate this evolving narrative of self-discovery and technical growth, I am reminded that even seemingly unrelated experiences can converge to shape a unique and promising future.
