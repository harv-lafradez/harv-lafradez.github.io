## The dilemma

Have you ever once looked at someone else's code and thought to yourself, "why do they code like that?". This is a common sentiment shared by myself and many other programmers who have had the misfortune of reviewing code written by others, where in various instances misplaced curly brackets and indentations are only a sliver of the issues that give rise to our frustration. Ideally, in a perfect world, everyone would program the exact same way regardless of the language, but alas, that is far from reality. Just as no two people will write the same essay using the same exact handwriting, the same can be said when coding a program, but in this context, the same coding conventions. That is, without the use of coding standards.

## A "one size fits all" tool

As an emerging programmer, I have had some exposure to coding standards, one being in the form of Checkstyle, which is the premier code analysis tool used for ensuring that Java source code is compliant with specified coding rules. The utilization of Checkstyle was heavily required back when I was learning the Java programming language, and quite frankly, I can now see why that was so in hindsight.
